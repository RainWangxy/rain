first try
hello the world!
It's Rain's introduction here!
To be honest,I feel a little stressful for this time since I got involved in so many things disturbing me a lot.But at the same time ,I found I fell in love with a boy,which is a really sweet thing and comforts me a lot.Anyway,I think everyone during this period will think a lot and grow up quickly and I believe things will become better soon.
